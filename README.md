# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis 🎬

This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative based on their text content.
The trained model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a common Natural Language Processing (NLP) task used to understand opinions expressed in text. In this project:

1. IMDb movie reviews are preprocessed and tokenized
2. An LSTM-based deep learning model is trained to learn sequential patterns in text
3. The model predicts whether a review expresses positive or negative sentiment

## 🧠 Model Used

1. Architecture: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
2. Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors
3. LSTM Layer: Captures contextual dependencies in text
4. Dense Output Layer: Binary classification (positive / negative)

## 📊 Results

Test Accuracy: 87%
The model generalizes well to unseen reviews and captures sentiment effectively.
